Erick: I just wish you could say the things, and then I'll just say "yes" or "no." 
Leslie: That’s called "leading the witness." It's not allowed.
Erick: [sighs.]
       I wish I could just write it down instead of saying it out loud.
Leslie: Oh, my God, Erik.
        You are so tense.
        Did you take your Xanax this morning?
Erick: No.
Leslie: Erik, you made me a promise.
        Did you bring any with you? 

<2><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Lyle: We don't want Grandma in the courtroom for any of it.
      She shouldn't hear it.
      It'll hurt her.
Jill: She won't be there.
      We talked to your aunt.
Lyle: I just I feel nauseous, Jill.
      I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Jill: Take some deep breaths and I'll get you some water.
      It'll help settle your stomach.
      Okay? 

<3><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Lyle: We had a puppy at the time, when I was six.
      Her name was Tristesse.
      I remember her and my dad playing outside and me running out.
      It was a good memory.
Jill: Do you have a good memory of your mother? 
Lyle: Yeah.
      I remember her taking care of the birds that would hit the windows and be, like, hurt in some way.
      She was just amazing with the birds.
Jill: And at this point, did sports become an important part of your life? 
Lyle: Yes.
      They were everything to my dad.
      That's what made him happy, and that's what I wanted to do.
Jill: Why did you want to make him happy? 
Lyle: So he would love me.
Jill: Did you love your mom and dad? 
Lyle: Yes.
Jill: And on August 20th, 1989, did you and your brother kill your mother and father? Lyle: Yes.

<4><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Leslie: What do you believe was the originating cause of you and your brother ultimately shooting your parents? 
Erick: Um…<PAS>Me telling…<PAS>
[breathes deeply.]
Leslie: You telling what? 
Erick: Me telling Lyle that…<PAS>[breathes deeply.]
[sighs, sniffs.]
Leslie: Was it you telling Lyle that something happened?
Erick: My dad…<PAS>My dad…<PAS>
Leslie: Your Honor, can I ask a leading question? 
Weisberg: No, no, he's in the process of answering.
          There's no need.
          Can you answer the question? 
Erick: Yes.
Leslie: Okay.
        It was you telling Lyle what? 
Erick: That…<PAS>[chokes.]
       my dad had been molesting me.
[cries.]

<5><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Jill: Did your dad used to have talks with you about sex between men? 
Lyle: Yes.
      It started when I was six, after sports practices.

<6><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Erick: At first it was just the legs and butt, and then he started massaging my penis, and he made me do the same to him.
Leslie: What was he like during these sessions? 
Erick: At first, he was great.
       He he had never been so caring and I loved that.
       I wanted him to love me.
Leslie: You said "at first." Did that change? [breathes deeply.]

<7><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Jill: Do you recognize the children in these photos? 
Lyle: That’s me, with the mole there.
      And that's Erik.
Lyle:<PAS> It’s around Erik's birthday.
Dad took photos of us bending over and stuff.
Jill: Did he do other things to you? 
Lyle: He got more involved.
      When I was, uh, seven, he would…<PAS>put me on my knees and…<PAS>and I would have oral sex with him.
      We'd have what we call the "object sessions," and…<PAS>he would…<PAS>stick a toothbrush…<PAS>in my anus.
      And then he used something else.
Jill: What was it? 
Lyle: <PAS>He raped me.
Jill: Did you cry? [cries.]
Lyle: Yes.
Jill: Did you bleed? 
Lyle: Yes.
Jill: Were you scared? [cries.]
Lyle: Yes.
Jill: Did you ask him not to? [breathes raggedly.]
Lyle: I just told him I didn't want to do this and that it hurt me and he said he didn't mean to hurt me, that he that he loved me.
Jill: And that was important to you, that he loved you.
Lyle: Yes.
<PAS>Very.
Jill: And during this period, did you do something to your brother?
Lyle: [cries.] God…<PAS>I took him out to the woods.
      I took a toothbrush…[cries.]<PAS>
      And Oh, God…<PAS>I played with him in the same way.
      Oh, God, Erik, I'm so sorry.
      I'm so sorry.
      I'm so I'm so sor… Oh, God.
Jill: Do you remember telling anyone about the abuse? 

<8><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Young Lyle: Mom Dad's touching me and doing things down there.
            I want him to stop.
Kitty: Don’t exaggerate, honey.
       Your father's just punishing you.
       That's what fathers do.

<9><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Young Lyle: Mom I want Dad to stop it.
Kitty: Don’t let your father see you like that.
       Put some drops in your eyes, and don't cry at dinner.

<10><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Erick: When I was 11, he had anal sex with me.
Leslie: What was he like during those encounters? 
        He was still nice at that point.
        He would stop if I said he was hurting me.
Leslie: Did he stay nice? 
Erick: No.
[sniffs.]
       When I was 12, he wanted me to be in pain.
       He would stick needles into my legs and butt.

<11><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Lyle: My father stopped when I was ten.
Jill: Was that the end of your sexual abuse in the home? 
Lyle: No.
Lyle: My mother was very loving when I touched her, but when I was 13, I stopped going into her bed.
Jill: How did she respond? 
Lyle: She turned on me.
      She started picking on me verbally, wishing I was dead.
Jill: Were you aware of any other abuse going on in your home? 
Lyle: I thought my father was abusing Erik.
Jill: Did you decide to do something about it? 
Lyle: I decided to confront my dad.


<12><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><SSX>
Young Lyle: Dad I know what's going on with you and Erik.
            I heard noises, and I want you to leave him alone.
Jose: Erik makes up things sometimes.
      But okay, it'll stop.
      You tell anyone, I'll kill you.
      You understand? [gasps.]

<13><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Erick: But he didn't stop.
       He just got worse.
       And he was doing all kinds of sex to me.
Leslie: Over the years, did you give those different types of behavior names? 
Erick: Yes.
       Oral sex was "knees." There was "nice sex" and "rough sex." And…<PAS>And then there was just "sex." 
Leslie: It was some form of intercourse? 
Erick: Yes.
       I felt sick all the time, and when I was 17, I just didn't want it anymore.
       I just was in a bad state that day, and he walked into my room and I said "no," and he threw me on the bed and went to get a knife and he put it at my throat and he raped me.
Leslie: Before your father died, in August of 1989, when was the last incidence of what you called "sex"? 
Erick: [sighs.]
       In May of 1989.
Leslie: And the last incidence of "knees"? 
Erick: In August, 1989, in my bedroom.
       I used to have this rescue fantasy, but no one ever came to rescue me.
       No one except my brother, Lyle.

<14><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Weisberg: All of this squeezing and patting Lawyers are not nursemaids or surrogate mothers.
              If you wanted to engage in that conduct, you should've gone into another line of work.
Leslie: ”Another line of work"? 
              Because I'm a woman? 
Weisberg: That makes no difference to me, but if you're gonna represent your gender in my courtroom, you'll do so by my rules.
Leslie: I don't represent anyone but my clients, but fine, I will take the court's cue.
Leslie: Good.
        Proceed.

<15><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Leslie: Now, Erik, over the summer of 1989, did you have any hope or dream for an improvement in your life? 
Erick: Uh, I was going to college.
       I applied to something like 13 colleges.
Leslie: Did you get accepted to any of them? 
Erick: Uh, Brown was interested.
       I'd get a tennis scholarship.
       Uh, it was all I thought about.
       It was everything in my life.
Leslie: And what happened? 
Erick: Dad said he wouldn't pay for Brown, or any schools out of state, and then I got accepted to UCLA, and I wanted to live on campus in a dorm.

<16><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><SSX>
Jose: You can have a dorm room, but I want you home four nights a week so I can review your work.
Erick: But I can go back to the dorm to sleep? 
No.
Jose: You’ll sleep here, four nights a week, or I'm not paying for this.
Erick: I knew for sure then: The sex it was never going to end, and I felt the hope that I had was gone.
Leslie: Did you contemplate any other plan? 
Erick: Um…<PAS>I planned to kill myself.
       I…<PAS>I thought I was a coward.
       I hated myself for it, and…<PAS>I got a razor blade and held it against my wrist, but I didn't have the guts.
Leslie: How long before your dad died, this happen? 
Erick: It was about ten days before.
Leslie: Did you consider talking to anyone about your situation? 
        To Dr. Oziel? 
Erick: No, he would just tell my parents.
       Uh, no.
       I thought of telling Lyle.
       I thought I thought I couldn't do that.
       I thought it would be too embarrassing to admit it.
Leslie: And did anything happen to change your attitude about that? 
Erick: Yes.

<17><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Lyle: Mom, please.
Kitty: You don't need it.
Lyle: I need it.
Kitty: : I don't care what you want, but you're not having it.
Lyle: Please, Mommy! I need it.
      It's not that big of a deal.
      No! 
      It's important to me! 
      Kitty: Who do you think you are?  
Lyle: Ow!  
Kitty: You don't need a goddamn hairpiece! Look.
       See? 
       You look fine.
[muttering.]
       You don't need a hairpiece


<18><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><SSP><SSX>
Erick: Lyle. <NME>
Lyle: What? 
Erick: Lyle, I need to talk to you.
Lyle: What do you want? 
Erick: I…
Lyle: What?  
Erick: Lyle, um that stuff with Dad is still going on.
Lyle: <PAS>Do you like it? [breathing heavily.]
Erick: Of course I don't like it.
       I hate it and I want to kill myself.
Lyle: Whoa, whoa, okay.
      I believe you.
      All right? 
Erick: [sobs.]
Lyle: Hey.
      Hey.
      We'll figure something out.

<19><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><SSX>
Young Lyle: I know what's going on with Erik, and it needs to end.
Jose: You listen to me.
      What I do with my son is none of your business.
      Just stay out of it.
      Don't throw your life away.
      Go back to Princeton and we'll forget this conversation took place.
Young Lyle: You’re a sick person.
            You're not touching Erik again.
            I'll tell everyone.
Jose: We all make choices in life.
      Erik made his, and now you've made yours.

<20><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Erick: Mom.
       Mom! Dad is still doing things to me.
       He's molesting me.
Kitty: I’ve always known.
       Do you think I'm stupid?

<21><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><SSP><SSX>
Erick: Dad just tried to attack me.
       He said he's not going to let you ruin him.
       I think they're gonna kill us.
       Lyle, Mom bought another rifle this summer.
       They have two rifles in their bedroom.
Lyle: We need to get out of this house.
Erick: And go where? I'm not gonna just run away and let Dad find and kill me.
       That's crazy.
Lyle: Why? 
Erick: Dad is powerful.
       Look who he is.
       Look who Mom is.
       There's nowhere we can go where they're not gonna just find us and kill us.
       Lyle…
Lyle: <ITR><MLE><ESP>Let’s just go to the police, then.
Erick: The Beverly Hills police? 
Lyle: Yes.
Erick: You think they're gonna believe us over him? Dad is a rich guy with a lot of power.
       I'm nothing! They're not gonna protect us.
       No one's going to protect us.
       Jesus They're gonna kill us.
       Look at him 

<22><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Erick: We needed a driver's license to get the guns.
           Uh, Lyle had his suspended in May, and I didn't have mine with me, so I used one Lyle gave me to get into clubs.
           It was his roommate's.
           I put mine in my room, under my bed.
Leslie: Did you speak to your parents when you got home that Friday? 
Erick: Yes.
       Mom, right away, came and said that Dad wanted us to go on this fishing trip with them the next day.
Leslie: And what conclusion did you draw from this? 
Erick: Uh We thought that they were gonna kill us on the boat.
       So Saturday, we drove around all day.
       The plan was to get home too late, that they would have to go without us.
But they waited for us.
       We had no choice.
       We had to go.
       The whole time, we stayed at the front of the boat, away from our parents, and I I was terrified.
       I thought we might die.
       I thought my dad could do it, like he said he would, and nobody would stop him.
Leslie: And when you returned home that night, did you talk to your parents? 
Erick: Yes.
Kitty: If you'd kept your mouth shut, things would've worked out in this family.
       I thought she meant we were over as a family, that Lyle and I were going to be killed.
       She'd given that away 
Erick: And I went right to my room.

<23><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Ferrero: Are they still On the 911 tape, are you crying? 
Lyle: Yes.
Ferrero: And were you also lying on that call? 
Lyle: I was.
Ferrero: So you're capable of crying and lying at the same time? 

<24><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Lester: Your car at the time was a Ford Escort.
        Did you buy a brand-new Jeep after killing your parents? 
Erick: I did, but…
Lester: <ITR><MIM><HSP>So, is it fair to say that killing your parents made it possible for you to achieve a certain lifestyle? 
        We thought we were disinherited.
        We were concerned that we would get nothing if our parents died.
Lester: Nothing? 
        Never occurred to you to get a job? 
Leslie: Objection, Your Honor.
        My client wasn't asked if he'd intended to get a job.
Weisberg: Overruled.
Leslie: Really?  
Weisberg: Really.
Ferrero: Did you love your mother? 
Lyle: Yes.
Ferrero: And when you put the gun to her cheek and fired, was that love? 
Lyle: It was confusion and fear.
Ferrero: You almost got away with it.
Jill: Object 
Lyle: <ITR><MIF><LSP>You know, you characterize it that way, and you think it's funny, but my brother's and my life were very miserable for six months before we got arrested, and our lives aren't good now.
      They never really have been great.
      In some ways, getting arrested, for my brother, was a relief.
      We may go off to prison, but, you know, some good things have come of it.

<25><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Psychiatrist: People who have been psychologically traumatized, by sex abuse, for example, have a faster biological response to fear than someone who's never been traumatized.
                  They also exhibit something called "hypervigilance," where they're constantly searching their own environment for anything that might be dangerous.
Jill: And did you find those traits in Lyle Menendez? 
Psychiatrist: Yes.
Jill: And can these traits lead someone to have a sincere, but unreasonable, belief that their life is in imminent danger? 
Psychiatrist:  Yes.
Jill: Thank you.
      Nothing further.
Ferrero: Approach, Your Honor? 

<26><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Ferrero: Your Honor, since the defense put the defendants' mental state at issue, the People request the court unseal the December 1989 tape of the defendants' session with Dr. Oziel.
Leslie: The California Supreme Court ruled that tape was inadmissible, due to patient-therapist privilege.
Weisberg: That no longer applies.
          Your clients waived confidentiality when they tendered their mental condition as the centerpiece of their defense.
          Tape is in.
Leslie: Your Honor, you can't overrule the California Supreme Court.
Weisberg: Just watch me.
          I'll be unsealing the tape.

<27><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Jill: It’ll be an issue for appeal.
Leslie: It’s too late.
        Have you heard those tapes lately? 
Oziel, the great Satan, leading our boys into saying whatever it is he wants them to say so he can blackmail them.
Jill: Well, they both sounded, especially Lyle, so cold-blooded.
Leslie: I know.
        Even though there's a reason for it, it is bad.
[over TV.]
Leslie: Well, at least we have the support of one community.
        Screw Weisberg.<TBW>
        We win by being honest, by not turning away from the truth.

<28><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Weisberg: Ms. Abramson, what are you doing? If the tape is in, it's in, Your Honor, but the defense will present it to the jury.<NME>
Ferrero: Your Honor, objection.
Leslie: It is my prerogative, Your Honor.
Weisberg: Overruled, Ms. Bozanich.
          Proceed.
Leslie: This tape was recorded on December 11th, 1989, by Dr. Jerome Oziel.
        On it, you will hear his voice, along with the voices of Erik and Lyle Menendez.

<29><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><SSP><DSX>
Uncle Brain Carlo: No emotion.
                       He might as well have been cutting steak.
Aunt Marta: Let’s get Mama out of here.
Uncle Brian: She knows what she heard.
Aunt Marta: Mama knows more than you think.

<30><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Aunt Marta: Ay, mira.
            So handsome.
Leslie: He took seven hours to come out.
Oh, he's beautiful.
Erick: Oh, Leslie, he's so precious.
Leslie: His name is Aidan.
Aunt Marta: Oh, that is such a nice name.
Granny: This is my baby.

<31><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Weisberg: All rise! 
[Judalon, there was $14 million involved in this, but you did what you did, and that's what you did.]
Leslie: And what do you think Dr. Oziel meant?  
Judalon: That the brothers were very rich and that Jerry Dr. Oziel was in the position to get a lot of money out of them, and now he wasn't
         Because they'd been arrested.
Leslie: Thank you.
        Nothing more.

<32><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><SSX>
Ferrero: Miss Smyth, you stated earlier that you went to Dr. Oziel, wanting to be married and to have children.<NME>
             Hasn't it been your primary motive in all of this to strong-arm Dr. Oziel into marrying you? 
Judalon: Incorrect.
Ferrero: You did testify that you wanted marriage and children.
Judalon: I did not want children who looked like Dr. Oziel.
[laughter.]

<33><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Lester: Ms. Pisarcik, is there anything you'd like to say concerning Erik's testimony about his brother's hairpiece? <NME>
J: Erik knew about Lyle's toupee long before the murders.
   We laughed about it in the spring or early summer of 1989, when I visited Lyle in LA.
Lester: Let me take you now to the months after Lyle Menendez's arrest in 1990.
        Did he ask you to do some research for him at the Santa Monica courthouse? 
J: Yes, he asked me to look up law cases.
   He gave me the names and numbers of cases with child molestation where the kids had killed their parents and gotten off.
   It was at that point that I began to doubt Lyle's innocence.
Lester: Thank you.
        Nothing further.

<34><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><SSX>
Leslie: What months would you consider spring and early summer? 
Jimmie: I’d say March through June.
Leslie: You were waitressing in New Jersey during those months, correct? 
Jimmie: Yes, but I visited Lyle in LA.
Leslie: See, I have here your timecards.
        You worked six days a week.
        When did you find time to fly to Los Angeles and joke with Erik about Lyle's toupee? 
Jimmie: I’m not sure.
Leslie: All right, I'll move on.
        When you did legal research for Lyle at the Santa Monica courthouse, what books did you use? 
Jimmie: I’m not sure I remember.
Leslie: Uh, was it a book like this, with the cases and judges' opinions? 
Jimmie: Yeah, just like that one.
Leslie: How many published cases did you find in which molested children were acquitted of killing their parents? 
Jimmie: Maybe three? 
Leslie: Now, you see, that's not possible.
        Did you know that only convictions are published in these books, not acquittals?

<35><DPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><SSP><DSX>
Leslie Husband: Dominick Dunne has lost his mind.
Leslie: <ITR><FLE><ESP>Shh, shh, shh.
Leslie Husband: Listen to this: "If Jose did stick needles and tacks into his son's thighs and buttocks" 
Leslie:  <ITR><FLE><ESP>Sh-sh-sh.
Leslie Husband: ”Didn't Erik bleed?" "Didn't he have scabs? "I tried sticking a thumbtack into my buttocks and I bled." 
Leslie: Shh.
        Dominick Dunne sticking a tack in his scrawny butt that's a lovely image.
[baby fusses.]
        He's the best.
        Reminds me why I do this.

<36><MPP><DRT><DLT><LAW><DSP><DSX>
Leslie Husband: You’ve had him a long time.
                    How 'bout I take over? 
Leslie: Tonight? No, not a chance.
        It's been six hours.
        We haven't heard a peep.
Leslie Husband: You don't really expect a quick verdict, do you? Your friend in the deputy's office maybe he heard something from his buddies in Van Nuys? 
Leslie Husband: Les…<PAS>You gotta at least take this night off.
                It's out of your hands.
                I know how you hate that.
Leslie: Yeah. [sighs.]

Amber Foley:Yeah, well, he didn't.
Meth Seth:Who is it, Am? 
Amber Foley:Justin's girlfriend.
Meth Seth:Girlfriend, huh? Tell that little shit<TBW> that his mother is worried sick, all right?

Meth Seth:Tell him call her today<TME> or don't bother coming home.

Justin Foley:Oh, shit<TBW>! What's with the fucking<TBW> water?
Bryce Walker:Just having some fun.
Justin Foley:"I'm just having some fun." 
Bryce Walker:Justy<NME>, you know you're welcome here all the damn<TBW> time, buddy, but I thought you were going home last night.
Justin Foley:Yeah, that guy Seth is back.
Bryce Walker:Meth Seth<NME>?
Justin Foley:Yeth.
Bryce Walker:And that's all, right? Just Meth Seth? 
Justin Foley:Yeah, just that asshole<TBW>. I can't deal with him, you know that.
Bryce Walker:Cause your girlfriend's texting me now. Brother, you know that Seth or whatever, I got your back, always.
Justin Foley:Yeah, I know.
Bryce Walker:Whatever you did, if you even fucking<TBW> did anything, we can take care of it. I mean anything. You know my one rule.
Justin Foley:Keep you clean.
Bryce Walker:Keep me clean. All right. And Jessica<NME>, take care of her, all right?  She's your girl.
Bryce Walker:You want some breakfast? Marisa the maid's here making some Mexican shit.
Justin Foley:You know she's Guatemalan, right? 
Bryce Walker:Sure. Hungry?
Justin Foley:Yeah.

Marcus Cole:Wanna help? 
Clay Jensen:Do I want help? 
Marcus Cole:Do you want to help? Put up posters.
Clay Jensen:No, no thanks, Marcus<NME>.
Marcus Cole:Come on, school spirit. All right? Making a contribution. Giving back.
Clay Jensen:Giving back to who, exactly?
Clay Jensen:Why are they playing in the courtyard? 
Marcus Cole:Uh, yeah. They asked student council. Thought it was a great idea. Got a concert tonight<TME>. We got some glum chums.

Band member A:Hey, Alex.
Alex Standall:Hey.
Band member A:You okay?
Alex Standall:Yeah, I just I overslept.
Band member A:Mr.McLean wants us to start with "Take Five."  He thinks that'll raise spirits.
Band member B:Love me some Brubeck.
Alex Standall:Though of course it was written by Paul Desmond, but whatever. If they want a spirit-raiser, how about "Gloomy Sunday"? 
Band member B:Are you serious? That song's totally depressing.
Alex Standall:Or it's beautiful, if you have taste.
Band member B:Or if you're suicidal.
Band member A:Way to go, Troy<NME>.
Band member B:Aw, shit<TBW>. Was he friends with Hannah Baker? I didn't know.

<5><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Is "Gloomy Sunday" really a song? 
Alex Standall:Yeah. Google "Hungarian Suicide Song." 
Clay Jensen:I'll take your word for it.
Clay Jensen:Alex<NME>. Can we, um<PAS> talk about this? 
Alex Standall:What is there to talk about?
Clay Jensen:Is Hannah telling the truth?
Alex Standall:What do you think? 
Clay Jensen:Did you do what she said you did? 
Alex Standall:Did you? 
Band member A:Alex<NME><ITR><FIM><ESP>. "Take the 'A' Train," with your solo.
Alex Standall:All right, well, I guess if I'm gonna be happy, may as well do it with the Duke.

Hannah Baker:Hey, Jess<NME>.
Jessica Davis:Hey.
Hannah Baker:Mrs. Antilly<NME>? 
Jessica Davis:Yeah.
Hannah Baker:Everything okay? 
Jessica Davis:What, like in the world? 
Hannah Baker:Or with you.
Jessica Davis:Yeah.
Hannah Baker:You could drop by our office later<TME>, if you want to make a full report.
Jessica Davis:Our office? 
Hannah Baker:Monet's.
Jessica Davis:Oh. Yeah, right. I forgot about that. The office thing.
Hannah Baker:Yeah. It's been a while<TME>.
Jessica Davis:Yeah, there's just so much going on.
Hannah Baker:Male! 
Alex Standall:Females.
Hannah Baker:Hey, how about a Monet's reunion today<TME>? You have a few drink selections left on your great menu journey. You were so committed once<TME>.
Jessica Davis:Yeah, commitment's hard for Alex.
Alex Standall:At least I have the ability to try something new in life.

Gary Bolan:Mrs. Baker<NME>. Hi. I wasn't expecting you. 
Olivia Baker:Olivia<NME>. Please.
Gary Bolan:Yeah. Well, come on in.
Olivia Baker:Thank you for making the time. I-I, uh<PAS> I know how busy you are.
Gary Bolan:No, not at all. What can I do for you? 
Olivia Baker:Well, I was, um<PAS>, I'm wondering if you could tell me something about Hannah's school life. I mean, was she unhappy here? 
Gary Bolan:Well I don't think I can answer that.
Olivia Baker:I know you can't possibly know every student, but my husband and I, we're still trying to understand.
Olivia Baker:At home, Hannah was Well, I mean sometimes she would run around the house singing show tunes in funny voices and showering us with hugs, and other times she was quiet and moody and it'd be hard to get a word out of her.
Gary Bolan:Sure.
Olivia Baker:But nothing she did told us she was capable of...
Gary Bolan:I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there<ITR><MLE><HSP>, Mrs. Baker<NME>. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't. Now that lawyers are involved.
Olivia Baker:What are you saying? 
Gary Bolan:What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Olivia Baker:I see. So then why are you? 
Gary Bolan:You and your husband are members of our school community, and we want nothing more than to support you during this time. I can only imagine your grief.
Olivia Baker:You can't imagine the first thing about my life right now<TME>.

<8><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Student A:Bryce is a total vampire.
Student B:That thing on your neck is huge.
Student A:Oh, I know, right?

<9><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Courtney Crimsen:Seriously, Tyler<NME>? 
Tyler Down:If you're going to do a memorial, I'm going to take pictures.

<10><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Courtney Crimsen:Mrs. Baker<NME>. Hi. I'm Courtney Crimsen. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope you like it. People keep adding to it. Um<PAS>, every day there's another card or more flowers.
Olivia Baker:All these people were Hannah's friends? 
Courtney Crimsen:Mm-hmm<PAS>. She had so many friends<PAS> and we all miss her so much.
Olivia Baker:Anyone who knew Hannah would know that she hated roses. She thought they were a cliche.

<11><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Hannah<NME>. Hey, Hannah<NME>. Hey.
Hannah Baker:Morning, Helmet<NME>. Urgent question. Have you noticed anything weird about Alex lately<NME>? 
Clay Jensen:Um<PAS> Well, his hair's weird, but that's not new.
Hannah Baker:His hair is awesome.
Clay Jensen:I didn't say it wasn't awesome, it's just, like, distinctive.
Hannah Baker:And he's an amazing dresser. I mean, you could take a few lessons.
Clay Jensen:I totally could. And I'm glad we got around to my failings because I was wondering when we would get to that.
Hannah Baker:Are you working tonight<TME>? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, we're both on at six<TME>. I mean, I think. On the schedule.
Clay Jensen:So, speaking of tonight<TME>, I don't know if you know this, but there's a penumbral lunar eclipse at 11:49<TME>.
Hannah Baker:A what? 
Clay Jensen:The Earth's shadow is the penumbra. Tonight<TME>, the moon is gonna pass through it. Last show is at nine<TME>, and if we clean fast, and we probably can, because no kids are coming to that English movie because it's boring, we could get out in time, and I could maybe point it out to you. If you want.
Hannah Baker:You want to show me the moon? 
Clay Jensen:There would be a shadow. Not like a full eclipse. You wouldn't exactly see the But, yeah.
Hannah Baker:You should, like, patent yourself. And, yes, I will look at the moon with you. I might even howl.
Clay Jensen:Cool. Cool. So, yeah, I'll see you tonight<TME>.

<12><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Sheri Holland:Anyways, is Justin still missing? 
Jessica Davis:He's not missing. I know exactly where he is.
Sheri Holland:So he's at Bryce's. Maybe you should go.
Jessica Davis:I shouldn't have to go. He should be here.
Sheri Holland:Then go get him. Drag him back to school by his perfect hair.
Jessica Davis:Right.
Sheri Holland:You know what? Tell him that you entered him into that costume contest. Two hundred bucks.
Jessica Davis:Yeah, maybe he could dress up as my actual boyfriend.

<13><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Mr. Porter:I spoke to Justin, but now<TME> I need to speak to Alex Standall. He dated Jessica Davis, who I spoke to yesterday<TME>. Justin Foley the day before<TME>. There was this rumor that Justin and Hannah had sex in a park. Justin said it was all a big joke, and Hannah blew it out of proportion.
Gary Bolan:Did you follow it up? 
Mr. Porter:Justin's been absent for the past two days<TME>.
Gary Bolan:Did you call home?
Mr. Porter:No answer. I spoke with Coach Patrick. Apparently, it's just his mom and a series of step-dads and boyfriends. Coach thinks there may have been abuse at some point in the past<TME>.
Gary Bolan:At home?
Mr. Porter:Yes.
Gary Bolan:And Jessica Davis? 
Mr. Porter:As I understand it, she was Hannah's first friend here. Uh<PAS>, now<TME> she's Justin's girlfriend.
Gary Bolan:So, I imagine she protected him.
Mr. Porter:Could be, or she doesn't know anything. She didn't say much.
Gary Bolan:This lawsuit could cost the district tens of thousands, hundreds, and that's if we win. We're already getting calls from the media.
Mr. Porter:Yeah. I understand.
Gary Bolan:And she never came to you, for help? 
Mr. Porter:We had a meeting last year<TME> about colleges.
Gary Bolan:All the time and resources we've dedicated to her now<TME>. If we'd known she needed help before...

<14>
Teacher:All right, young people. Let the learning commence. We've got a film today<TME>, continuing on our World War II unit. It's full of facts, even though technically it's fiction. No talking, no texting. No sleeping.

<15><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:Ironic, as he will sleep through the whole thing.
Sheri Holland:Right? Remember when he showed Gladiator for Roman history? 
Clay Jensen:Oh, yeah.
Clay Jensen:Seriously, John Wayne? 
Sheri Holland:Shh. You're gonna disturb his nap.
Clay Jensen:Cover me if he wakes up.
Sheri Holland:Okay.

<16><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:Alex<NME>...<PAS>
Alex Standall:Go back to class, Clay<NME>.
Clay Jensen:What are you doing? 
Alex Standall:I'm cleaning up. What, they think these are gonna save someone's life? "Suicide's not an option"? Yeah, you know what? Clearly it is an option, you know? Why don't they put up a poster that says "Don't be a dick<TBW>"? Why don't we put up that poster? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, that would be cool with me. I try not to be a dick.
Alex Standall:Yeah, we all try.
Clay Jensen:So, did you do it? What Hannah says you did to her and Jessica.
Alex Standall:What do you think?
Tyler Down:What are you doing? 
Alex Standall:I'm recruiting Clay for the Illuminati. You want to join? 
Tyler Down:Alex<NME>, you should not joke about the Illuminati, first of all. Trust me. What are you guys talking about? 
Clay Jensen:Homework. We've got a project.
Tyler Down:Yeah, right. The old project trope. The only class you two have together is gym.
Alex Standall:It's creepy that you even know that. Just go away.
Clay Jensen:What I think<PAS> is that you wouldn't do something like that. I thought you loved Jessica.
Alex Standall:I did. I mean<PAS> Maybe I even still do, but...
Clay Jensen:Then why would you...
Alex Standall:We can't be talking about this.<ITR><MLE><ESP>
Mr. Porter:Guys<ITR><MLE><HSP>. Where are you supposed to be? 
Alex Standall:That's a heavy question. That's, like, existential.
Mr. Porter:Alex<NME>. Why don't you come with me. I been wanting to talk to you.
Alex Standall:Okay.
Mr. Porter:Clay<NME>, you can come along too.
Mr. Porter:Uh<PAS>, Coach Patrick sent me to the library. He has the wrong DVD for today<TME>, so the whole class is waiting.
Mr. Porter:All right. Let's catch up later<TME>.

<17><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:Find anything worth publishing? 
Ryan Shaver:Oh, hardly. Just the usual angst, despair, lovelorn crap. Uninspired.
Ryan Shaver:But I am planning a special issue in memory of Hannah Baker. Maybe you have something to add? 
Clay Jensen:Uh<PAS>, no, not really.

<18><MPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:He's still in there.
Clay Jensen:Is he okay? The credits ended five minutes ago<TME>.
Hannah Baker:Here he comes.
Alex Standall:Good night<TME>, I guess.
Hannah Baker:No Jessica tonight<TME>? 
Alex Standall:Uh<PAS>, no.
Clay Jensen:So, you all good, man? 
Alex Standall:Yeah. See you guys.
Clay Jensen:You do ticket count, I'll do concessions. Ten minutes<TME> to go!

<19><MPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Yep. I got you.
Hannah Baker:Okay.
Clay Jensen:Okay, so now you're gonna put your left leg over. Yep, that's right. There you go.
Hannah Baker:Okay. Thanks.
Hannah Baker:What am I supposed to be seeing?
Clay Jensen:Just a shadow over the moon. Look, it's growing slowly.
Hannah Baker:A shadow<PAS>...growing slowly 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, just little bit by little bit. Look closely.
Hannah Baker:Wait, I see it. I see it.  It's kind of scary.
Clay Jensen:Is it? Oh.

<20><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Morning<TME>, Astronomy Boy<NME>.
Clay Jensen:Better than Helmet, I guess.

<21><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:It's good. We just need to work on structure, and you use the word "unique," like, seven times. If one thing is unique, the other six things should probably be, um<PAS> - something else.
Jeffrey Atkins:What's wrong with unique? If something's unique, it means it's different, right? I'm saying this type of literature is different than other kinds of literature. I mean, it is. Isn't it, Jensen<NME>? Clay<NME>.
Jeffrey Atkins:Ah, You saw the list.
Clay Jensen:She does have a...<PAS>
Jeffrey Atkins:Unique lips. Yeah. You should get her number.
Clay Jensen:Don't want her number. I'm just - 
Jeffrey Atkins:Thinking about kissing her.
Clay Jensen:I am not.
Jeffrey Atkins:Congrats, Angie<NME>. Looking good.
Angie:Thank you, Jeffrey<NME>.
Skye Miller:Shh! Library. Looking good, Clay<NME>.
Clay Jensen:Hey, Skye<NME>. Sorry.
Jeffrey Atkins:Oh, man. Don't tell me you've got a thing for Twilight.
Clay Jensen:I don't. I mean No, we just used to be friends.
Jeffrey Atkins:Huh. Cool. She's a pretty girl. I mean I don't know why she dresses like that. But at least she's unique.

<22><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Mind if I join? 
Hannah Baker:No geometry homework? 
Clay Jensen:No, I did it last night<TME>. My mom's prepping this trial, so she makes us do our homework together. It's highly annoying, but I do admit it's cool to have homework done before the period before<TME>.
Hannah Baker:High school is bullshit.
Clay Jensen:Yeah. Don't disagree. But any specifics? 
Hannah Baker:I wish there was a button to fast-forward you through all the shitty<TBW> parts in life straight to the good parts.
Clay Jensen:And where are the good parts? 
Hannah Baker:College. In New York City.
Clay Jensen:Why New York? 
Hannah Baker:The minute I get there, I can be someone else. Whoever I want to be.
Clay Jensen:But who you are now is okay.
Hannah Baker:Okay? High praise. Thank you.
Clay Jensen:I mean, is awesome. You're-<PAS>I mean, you made the hot list.
Hannah Baker:Seriously, Clay<NME>? 
Clay Jensen:What? They said you had the best.. That's out of a lot of good candidates. Not that I've surveyed, I'm just saying.
Hannah Baker:What if girls made a list and you got<PAS> worst biceps.
Clay Jensen:Girls would probably never do that list.
Hannah Baker:Precisely.
Clay Jensen:And my biceps are at least better than Alex's. That kid hasn't lifted so much as a carton of milk in years, I think.
Hannah Baker:Once again, you and the point are complete strangers.

<23><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:Hey, uh, where were you going on Friday night<TME> when we passed?
Tony Padilla:I was running some errands.
Clay Jensen:In Hannah's old neighborhood?
Tony Padilla:You guys got the best stores on your side of town. Rich white folk.
Clay Jensen:We're not rich.
Clay Jensen:You're related to Angie Romero, right?
Tony Padilla:Yeah. She's like my third cousin, maybe fourth.
Clay Jensen:Why doesn't she go here anymore?
Tony Padilla:She transferred to Catholic school.
Clay Jensen:Why?
Tony Padilla:I don't know. Her dad is really strict and super Catholic.
Clay Jensen:Didn't have to do with her lips, did it? 
Tony Padilla:Her lips? Oh, 'cause she was on the list?
Clay Jensen:Was that list a thing for her, like it was for Hannah?
Tony Padilla:I don't think so.
Clay Jensen:But Hannah-
Tony Padilla:Hannah got hurt. It happens. You never really know what's gonna hit how. You don't know someone else's life.
Clay Jensen:You would know, right?
Tony Padilla:Heads up!
Clay Jensen:Ow! Son of a bitch<TBW>! 
Trainer:Jensen! Language!

<24><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Alex Standall:What were you saying to Tony? 
Clay Jensen:Nothing, really. Why? 
Alex Standall:Mr. Porter's asking questions. Don't tell him anything. And stop talking to Tony about it.
Clay Jensen:Tony's my friend.
Alex Standall:No, not right now he's not.
Zach Dempsey:Yo, Standall. Eating lunch with us later<TME>? I'm driving.
Alex Standall:Uh Yeah, cool. Meet me at Monet's after school<TME>, okay?

<25><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Alex<NME>! Alex Standall<NME>! Alex<NME>, what the hell<TBW>! What were you thinking? Seriously! 
Zach Dempsey:Come on. Hannah<NME>, you know you can't be in here.
Hannah Baker:Why not? You've all been staring at my ass all day<TME>.
Trainer:Hey. Hey! Get out. It's the boys' locker room.
Hannah Baker:We're not done.

<26><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Bryce Walker:Yeah, boy! Hannah Baker<NME>. You hittin' that now? Aren't you with Jessica? 
Alex Standall:Uh, no, not anymore.
Bryce Walker:Cause Jessica's a good girl, right? But Hannah Baker puts out.
Justin Foley:Yeah, man, just be careful. Hannah's a crazy bitch<TBW>! 
Bryce Walker:As Justin knows.
Zach Dempsey:Man, how is little Alex getting more than all us? 
Bryce Walker:Uh, speak for yourself, big guy. I get all I need. Come on. Let's go watch the girls warm up.
Justin Foley:You coming, Standall<NME>?  Or are you too hot for us now<TME>?

<27><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Student A:You got this. Just breathe.
Alex Standall:Leave me alone.

<28><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Jessica Davis:Trust me, it will be fun.
Justin Foley:So this contest is tomorrow<TME>? 
Jessica Davis:Yeah, but you actually have to be there to win.
Justin Foley:I will. I promise.
Jessica Davis:You promised before<TME>.
Justin Foley:There's just a lot of shit going on at home, okay? Seth is back, so it's just... <PAS>easier for me to stay at Bryce's, that's all.
Jessica Davis:Am I supposed to be scared? Should I be, Justin<NME>? Scared.
Justin Foley:Never. There's nothing to be scared of.
Trainer:Justin<NME>!
Justin Foley:Uh, hey, Coach<NME>.
Trainer:Missed you at the pep rally. And at practice.
Justin Foley:Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. I've just had this stomach virus.
Jessica Davis:Yeah, we just got his medicine.
Trainer:Mm-hmm. Everything all right at home? 
Justin Foley:Yes, sir, I've just been sick. I'll be there tomorrow<TME>. I won't let you down.
Trainer:I'm not worried about you letting me down, son. Colleges look at things like school attendance, game attendance, your grades.
Justin Foley:Yes, sir.
Trainer:Okay. Now you take that medicine.
Trainer:And, son get yourself some eye drops while you're at it.

<29><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Oh. Hey. You work here now<TME>?
Skye Miller:You drink coffee now<TME>? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah. I mean, I just sort of started.
Skye Miller:Look at our little Clay, all grown up. So, do you want one now<TME>? 
Clay Jensen:Oh, right. Uh A small drip, please. Black.
Skye Miller:Que macho.
Clay Jensen:Is that a lizard on your neck? 
Skye Miller:It's an alligator.
Clay Jensen:How many do you have now<TME>? Tattoos.
Skye Miller:Why? Do you want to give your opinion? Everyone else feels entitled to.
Clay Jensen:No, I just...I just wondered. I like the alligator.
Skye Miller:Remember that story I used to tell about my parents every time we drove over a bridge? 
Clay Jensen:I remember...<PAS> No, wait, I forgot.
Skye Miller:When I was little, I used to cry every time we drove over a bridge. I don't know why. My mom used to try to distract me...
Clay Jensen:--And she would tell you to look for a purple alligator in the water<ITR><MLE><ESP>, and you'd be so busy looking you'd forget you were scared.
Skye Miller:Yeah, that's the story.
Skye Miller:It's on the house.

<30><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Mr. Porter:Do you think it might have been Clay who tore the posters down?
Courtney Crimsen:I don't think so. Clay and I are pretty close. It's just not something he would do.
Mr. Porter:Hmm<PAS>. Can you think of anyone else who might have wanted to act out like that, about suicide or Hannah Baker's suicide? 
Marcus Cole:I can't think of anyone in particular. No, I...<PAS>I know it's hit a lot of kids hard.
Mr. Porter:You two were friends with Hannah? 
Marcus Cole:Well, "friends" is...
Courtney Crimsen:I had a couple of classes with her.<ITR><FIM><ESP>
Marcus Cole:No, but she wasn't involved in much, student council or anything, so...
Mr. Porter:Hm. Did she ever talk about how she was feeling? 
Marcus Cole:Most of the time she seemed pretty chill to me.
Courtney Crimsen:I guess there were times she was emotional. But who isn't? 
Mr. Porter:Yeah, that's true. I'm just trying to look out for the kids who got hit extra hard by this. I spoke with Alex Standall today<TME>.

<31><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:How many espressos are in there? 
Alex Standall:A lot.
Clay Jensen:I just started drinking coffee. I'm not sure it's such a good idea. I get anxiety.
Alex Standall:Yeah, me too.
Clay Jensen:So, did you do it? I mean, did you put Hannah and Jessica on that list? 
Alex Standall:You didn't know that? But you saw it.
Clay Jensen:Yeah, but I didn't, like, trace the handwriting. I didn't think it was that big a deal. I mean, do you think she's right? Does everything that happened to her go back to you and that list? 
Alex Standall:Well, I think it all started the night of Jessica's party<TME>.
Clay Jensen:What did she say about Jessica's party? Does she mention me there? 
Alex Standall:Where are you in the tapes? 
Clay Jensen:I'm almost through yours.
Alex Standall:Holy shit, Clay<NME>. I mean I listened to 'em all in one night the first time<TME>.
Clay Jensen:You listened more than once? 
Alex Standall:I listened to 'em twice. Thought maybe I'd dreamed the whole thing. Wait, so you haven't heard your own tape? 
Clay Jensen:No. I can only listen in bits and pieces, or I...<PAS>I freak out. I feel a panic attack coming on.
Alex Standall:Aren't you desperate to hear yours, though? 
Clay Jensen:I'm afraid to.
Alex Standall:Well, you should be.
Clay Jensen:But I mean, seriously, it was just a list. Like, a stupid high school thing.
Alex Standall:That fucking<TBW> list. I wish I never touched that fucking<TBW> list.
Clay Jensen:Why did you? 
Alex Standall:I don't know. Bryce started it. All the guys were working on it at lunch.
Clay Jensen:Why are you even friends with those guys? Justin<NME>, Zach<NME>, Bryce<NME>.
Alex Standall:No, see, I'm not friends with Bryce. But the other guys, Zach and I got to be friends last year<TME>, and he's always hanging around Justin. They thought it was funny and stuff. My dad was relieved that I had male friends. Also, didn't totally suck<TBW> at school that Justin Foley liked me back then.
Clay Jensen:Okay, back then.
Clay Jensen:Why are you friends now<TME>? 
Alex Standall:Because if I stop hanging out, they're gonna know something's up. I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Clay Jensen:Seriously?
Alex Standall:Yes.
Clay Jensen:But you don't even deserve to be on there. I mean, you meant it as a compliment.
Alex Standall:No. No. I meant it to piss Jessica off. Because she wouldn't have sex with me.
Clay Jensen:That doesn't seem like you.
Alex Standall:Yeah, it doesn't, does it? But it was. And the guys already thought that we were, and I wanted to. You know? I-I loved her. And it did piss Jessica off, but not at me. At Hannah.
Alex Standall:So not only did everyone think Hannah gave it up for me I took away her best friend. And who knows? If she had a friend, maybe... 
Clay Jensen:It's okay, man.
Alex Standall:No, it's not. It's not okay. You want it to be okay because then you get off the hook, but you're losing your shit<TBW>. You want to think whatever you did couldn't be why Hannah killed herself. But the truth is that I did, I killed Hannah Baker! And Justin killed Hannah Baker. And Jessica. And you. We all killed Hannah Baker.
Clay Jensen:Maybe you need some chamomile tea.
Alex Standall:Cause people are listening? Well, it's too bad no one paid attention before<TME>.
Clay Jensen:What is that about?
Alex Standall:I told you. He's not your friend. He's not even on the tapes. Tony<NME>, he's in this for Tony.
Clay Jensen:Alex<NME>. Alex!<NME>

Hannah Baker:Hey, Wally<NME>.
Mr. Wally:Oh, hey.
Hannah Baker:Wally<NME>, Why do you even sell candy bars that don't have nuts in them? 
Mr. Wally:Cause some people don't like nuts. And some people are allergic.
Hannah Baker:Some people are tragic.
Bryce Walker:What's up, Wally<NME>?
Mr. Wally:What's up?
Mr. Wally:So, I see you went for nuts again.
Bryce Walker:That's how you talk to a lady, Wally<NME>? I got the candy. Your parents own Baker Drugs, right? But you buy candy here? 
Hannah Baker:Um<PAS>, better selection. And fewer moms counting my calorie intake.
Bryce Walker:There you go.
Hannah Baker:Did you just<PAS>?
Bryce Walker:Oh<ITR><MIF><ESP>, no, I didn't mean It's just...It's real tight. In the store. It's tight in the store. I don't usually listen to sophomore gossip, but, um<PAS> for what it's worth, that list got it right.

Clay Jensen:Hi, are are you Wally? 
Shopping Assistant:No. Wally's off.
Bryce Walker:What's up, my man?
Shopping Assistant:Hey, how you doin', Bryce<NME>? 
Bryce Walker:What's up, Jensen<NME>? 
Clay Jensen:Uh<PAS>, hey, Bryce<NME>.
Bryce Walker:You live around here? 
Clay Jensen:Um<PAS>, no. A friend told me about it.
Bryce Walker:Yeah, me too. It's an easy card.
Bryce Walker:You looking for a cold one? Tough day? 
Clay Jensen:No, I just I came to grab some sugary carbonated matter.
Bryce Walker:Stuff's not good for you, man. What you need's something all-natural. Malt liquor. Made from barley.
Clay Jensen:Um, I don't have I.D.
Bryce Walker:Stand on your tippy-toes. Look old.
Shopping Assistant:I.D.? 
Clay Jensen:Uh<PAS>, I must have left it at home, or at my high school.
Bryce Walker:I got both.
Clay Jensen:You don't have to...
Bryce Walker:Sure I do.<ITR><MLE><ESP> You're welcome. Keep it.
Bryce Walker:Thank you, sir.

Justin Foley:Oh, that's cute. Come on. You come all the way out to Blue Spot. You let Bryce-y buy you a beer.
Clay Jensen:No, I really gotta...
Justin Foley:No, the least you can do is drink with us.<ITR><MLE><ESP> Come on. Drink your 40. Alex, you're up, man! 
Bryce Walker:Oh, yes, I love it, I love it. Freak versus geek! Time trial. Forty ounces. Let's do it.
Clay Jensen:Don't you have a concert? 
Alex Standall:I did, yeah, but<PAS> actually, I quit jazz band. It's just pointless.
Bryce Walker:Oh, look! Your boyfriend's waiting for you.
Zach Dempsey:The record is 18 seconds.
Bryce Walker:Whassup! 
Clay Jensen:Wait, to drink it all?
Bryce Walker:Yes. To drink it all.
Justin Foley:There's two ways you leave, Jensen<NME>: buzzed or beat down.
Zach Dempsey:Come on, Jensen, don't be a bitch<TBW>!
Bryce Walker:All right, here we go. You ready? Five, four, three, two, one!
Bryce Walker:Go, go, go, go! You got it! Come on, you got it! Go, go! Come on, Jensen<NME>! No turning back! Let's go! Come on, keep going! Go, go, go, go! It's so fucking<TBW> close! Go, go! So close! Oh, my God, Jensen<NME>! Attaboy! What the fuck<TBW>! Okay, all right.

Clay Jensen:Hey, really appreciate your help.
Tony Padilla:Looked like you were having a good time.
Clay Jensen:Why are you following me? 
Tony Padilla:I wasn't. I saw you with Alex. I thought you were on his tape.
Clay Jensen:Why were you with Mrs. Baker earlier? 
Tony Padilla:Look, if you can't trust me, I can't help you.<ITR><MLE><ESP>

Justin Foley:Who gets drunk off of one fucking<TBW> beer?
Zach Dempsey:Well, you can if it's a 40. And if you chug it. And if you're that small.
Justin Foley:And if you're a fucking pussy<TBW>.
Zach Dempsey:Okay, yeah, maybe he's a pussy<TBW>, but he can make a fuckload of trouble for us right now<TME>. Especially if he starts talking to Bryce.
Justin Foley:He's not gonna talk to Bryce. He's not gonna talk to anybody. And he can't hide behind Tony forever. Sooner or later<TME>, we're gonna bring him out into the open and shut him down.

Clay Jensen:Hey.
Lainie Jensen:(Here he is.)
Clay Jensen:Sorry I'm late. I got a little distracted on my way home.
Lainie Jensen:Said you'd be here half an hour ago<TME>. Where were you? 
Clay Jensen:Uh<PAS> I was with a friend. She was in trouble, and I...I didn't believe her, so I checked it out and it was true. She was telling the truth.
Lainie Jensen:Are you drunk? 
Clay Jensen:I think so.
Matt Jensen:Wow, this is escalating fast.
Lainie Jensen:You've never done anything like this before<TME>. Drinking on a school night<TME>? Riding your bike while drunk? 
Clay Jensen:I'm sorry about that.
Matt Jensen:How much did you drink, son? 
Clay Jensen:Just one beer. It was a big beer, though, and it was disgusting.
Lainie Jensen:All right, enough. You are grounded. For two weeks<TME>, you will go straight to school and come straight home afterwards, no activities, no hanging out with friends.
Matt Jensen:Okay, before we get to the sentencing phase, let's all just sit down to dinner. You need some food and water in you, and then we can talk about...
Clay Jensen:No, I don't, actually.<ITR><MIM><LSP> I'm not that hungry. Um<PAS>, I think I'm just gonna go to my room...<PAS>

Justin Foley:What the hell are you doing?
Clay Jensen:Nothing. I'm just--<PAS>
Justin Foley:Looking for something?
Clay Jensen:What would I be looking for?
Justin Foley:You tell me.
Clay Jensen:Do you even know my name?
Justin Foley:Course I do, Clay. 
(Mr.Porter:Guys. Second bell.)<ITR><MLE><HSP>
Justin Foley:You're not that innocent, Jensen. I don't give a shit what she says.<TBW>

Ms. Bradley:So, there are a number of ways to get help if you need it, or if a friend does, okay. And all of this information is on the board outside of my room or outside of the main office. It's on the Liberty High home page.
Pratters:Ms. Bradley<NME><ATT><NSF>, is it possible we could be done with all this? I mean, it's been over a week. Isn't it healthy to, like, move on?
Ms. Bradley:Okay, everyone, thank you.
Pratters:Seriously, I know, it's tragic, but I don't want to keep being reminded all the time. It's depressing.
Ms. Bradley:We're never done with it, Mr. Pratters<NME><ISR>, which is why it's important to know the signs that someone you care for might need help. I mean, are they withdrawing from friends and family? Is there a change in their appearance? Are they having trouble in... The group collaboration project is worth one-fifth of your semester grade total, so--Okay, so, please be committed and constant and fair to each other.

<4><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:I like the hair. The short hair. I liked the long hair, too. And, um<PAS>, I realize this makes me seem wishy-washy, and I should have said something the other night<TME>, and in truth I don't actually like change, but this change seems cool.
Hannah Baker:Thanks, Clay.<NME><PSF><NULL>

<5><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Ms. Bradley:Clay?<NME><ATT> Clay<NME><ATT>. Clay<NME><ATT>.<ITR><FLE><HSP>

Ms. Bradley:Are you with us?
Clay Jensen:Yeah, no, I am, I'm with you.
Mrs.Bradley:So, between now and then<TME>, observe yourself. Bring in information.

<6><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Mr.Porter:The students did this on their own. We thought it just best to leave it.
Olivia Baker:I see.
Mr.Porter:I'm sorry, um<PAS> Let me try this again.
Andy Baker:You'd think there'd be a master key or something.
Mr.Porter:Yeah, there was, once.
Olivia Baker:She doesn't have any stickers or pictures inside. Why doesn't she have any stickers? 
Andy Baker:Honey<NME><ATT><NGF><ISR>, it's just a locker.<ITR><MIF><ESP>
Olivia Baker:No, it's Hannah's locker. Why is it like that? 
Mr.Porter:Ma'am<NME><NGF><ISR>, I really don't know.
Olivia Baker:This is everything, then? 
Mr.Porter:Yes. I mean, we can go through the rest in my office. That way I can return the textbook.
Andy Baker:We just need anything personal.
Olivia Baker:The lawyer said bring everything. 
Andy Baker:Lawyers say a lot of things.

<7><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Tyler Down:Oh. Hey, Clay.<NME><ATT><NGF>
Clay Jensen:Hey, Tyler.<NME><ATT><NGF><SAT>
Tyler Down:What? 
Clay Jensen:Nothing.

<8><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Bryce Walker:No, no, Mom<NME><NULL>, it's a stupid school e-mail. You do not need to come ho Uh, hey, hold on. What the fuck<TBW> are you doing? 
Tyler Down:Nothing. Just yearbook stuff.
Bryce Walker:Get out, dude<NME><ISR><NGF>. Hey, sorry. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Everything's fine here. Just stay in Aspen.Yes, I am sure, Mother<NME><NULL>, 100 percent sure. Put Dad on the phone.

<9><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Courtney Crimsen:Clay.<NME><ATT> How are you doing, sweetie<NME><PSF><ISR><MPH>? You've been on my mind.
Clay Jensen:Hey, Courtney.<NME><ATT><NGF> I have? 
Courtney Crimsen:Well, I just feel like we all need to be there for each other at a time like this, you know? 
Clay Jensen:Sure.
Courtney Crimsen:It's all just so sad. It just doesn't make sense, right? 
Clay Jensen:No. But, um<PAS> a lot of things don't make sense.
Courtney Crimsen:Exactly. So true. Some things, you know, just don't have simple explanations, right? 
Clay Jensen:Right. Yeah.
Courtney Crimsen:I'm glad we got to talk. Bye.
Clay Jensen:Yeah, good talk.

<10><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Tony Padilla:Hey, Clay.<NME><ATT> You want a ride home? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, sure.
Tony Padilla:No bike today? 
Clay Jensen:Uh, no, Mom wanted to drive me, and, you know, talk about things.
Tony Padilla:Oh.<PAS> Can I play you a tape? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, of course. You're still on the old media, huh? 
Tony Padilla:Uh, it's so much better.
Clay Jensen:Everything was better before.
Tony Padilla:You said it, son<NME><ISR><PSF>.

<11><DPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Like so. Now, if they ask you if it's real butter, what do you say? 
Clay Jensen:It's a butter-based product.
Hannah Baker:And smile when you say it. I know, terrifying. But it sells the big lie. Oh, and, uh, little trade secret: If they're cute, only put butter on the top so they have to come back for more during the movie.
Clay Jensen:Okay, uh, why? 
Hannah Baker:So you can chat 'em up.
Clay Jensen:Oh, chat's not really my thing.
Hannah Baker:I like it. I think we're gonna get along. As long as you remember I started here three weeks<TME> before you, so I have seniority, which is why I'm training you. Which is insane if you think about it, because I just moved here two months ago<TME> and I have no idea what I'm doing.
Clay Jensen:I think it's going well.
Hannah Baker:Do you like it? Here? 
Clay Jensen:At the Crestmont? I find the various smells fascinating.
Hannah Baker:No, this town.
Clay Jensen:Oh, right. Uh I don't have anything to compare it to. I've lived here all my life. It's like asking Han Solo "How is space?" 
Hannah Baker:Wow! You're an actual nerd, aren't you? I admire that. There's courage in being a nerd.

<12><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Tony Padilla:Catch you later.<TME>

<13><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:Dad<NME><ATT>, where's your radio thing? 
Matt Jensen:"My radio thing"? 
Clay Jensen:That thing you play CDs on when you're painting or working in the yard or whatever.
Matt Jensen:My boom box.
Clay Jensen:That really what they're called? 
Matt Jensen:They were. I believe now they're called obsolete. Uh, yeah, it's in the workshop.
Clay Jensen:It plays tapes, right? 
Matt Jensen:It does, last I checked. How were things at school today<TME>? 
Clay Jensen:Same. Everyone's still acting weird.
Matt Jensen:And you? Um<PAS> How are you doing? 
Clay Jensen:Me? I'm fine. I'm good. So, can I I can use the boom box? 
Matt Jensen:Yes, of course. The boom box. Go. But keep in touch. Okay? 
Clay Jensen:Sure thing, Dad<NME><NULL>.

<14><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Lainie Jensen:Whatcha doing?
Clay Jensen:Jesus!
Lainie Jensen:Sorry.
Clay Jensen:What have we said about helicopter parenting? 
Lainie Jensen:I didn't mean to scare you. You were just lost in what is that you're listening to? 
Clay Jensen:It's, uh..<PAS> it's nothing. It's for history class.
Lainie Jensen:Cassettes are history now? 
Clay Jensen:Hm! 
Lainie Jensen:Of course they are. Can I listen? 
Clay Jensen:No, uh, it's dumb. I'm gonna head up to my room. Homework.
Lainie Jensen:Clay<NME><ATT><SOT>, school emailed again today.
Clay Jensen:Which explains why Dad showed interest in my life. You two are dangerous when you coordinate.
Lainie Jensen:You know I hate being the kind of parent who asks if you want to talk about anything, but if you want to talk about anything. 
Clay Jensen:I didn't really know her, Mom<NME><NULL>.
Lainie Jensen:Didn't you two work together at the Crestmont? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, for a little while<TME>.
Lainie Jensen:But you didn't know her very well? 
Clay Jensen:Not really. I need to get to work...  - Shit! <TBW>
Lainie Jensen:Language.
Clay Jensen:I'm sorry. I gotta I gotta go work. This thing is due in two days<TME>, so I gotta go.
Lainie Jensen:Clay.<NME><ATT> Slow down, hon. It's just homework.
Clay Jensen:Yeah. Thanks, Mom<NME><NULL>.

<15><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:I have to go to Tony's.
Lainie Jensen:Hold on, Tony's? Now<TME>? 
Clay Jensen:He needs one of the tapes. We're working together.
Lainie Jensen:Dinner's in a half hour<TME>.
Clay Jensen:Make me a plate for later? 
Lainie Jensen:Text me if you're gonna be later than really late.
Clay Jensen:I will. Bye.
Lainie Jensen:Bye.

<16><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Tony's Dad:Hand me the screwdriver.
Tony Padilla:Okay.
Clay Jensen:Hey, Tony<NME><ATT>.
Tony Padilla:Hey, Clay<NME><NULL>.
Clay Jensen:Something wrong with her?
Tony's Dad:Nothing wrong yet.  It's called taking care of things.
Tony Padilla:Dad<NME><ATT><SOT>, you remember Clay.
Tony's Dad:Yeah, sure. How you doing, Clay<NME>? 
Clay Jensen:I'm well, thank you.
Tony Padilla:So, Clay<NME><SOT>, what's up? 
Clay Jensen:Nothing. I was, uh I was out for a ride.
Tony Padilla:On the other side of town? 
Tony's Dad:That should do it. Start her up.
Tony Padilla:Hand me the rag.
Clay Jensen:I'll do it.
Tony's Dad:If we got the timing right, we'll hear it. Okay, flip the ignition. You hear that? That's how it should sound.
Tony Padilla:That sounds different?
Tony's Dad:Yeah, it's different. Are you deaf? 
Tony Padilla:Sounds the same as before.
Tony's Dad:Then you are deaf. That's so much smoother. Like night and day.
Tony Padilla:Smoother? ...
Tony's Dad:I don't think so. I know, and you should too. That's why I'm showing you this. Okay, shut her off.
Clay Jensen:I should get out of here.
Tony Padilla:Sure you don't want to stay for dinner? 
Clay Jensen:No, thanks. My mom's making pork chops. If I'm not home soon, she'll call the cops or something.
Tony Padilla:They emailed all the parents again.
Clay Jensen:Oh, I know.
Tony's dad:She leave a note? Girl who killed herself? 
Clay Jensen:Uh I don't know.
Tony's dad:Well, you listen to me. You ever do that to your mother, I will kill you, you understand? I'll kill you dead. Clean this shit<TBW> up.
Tony Padilla:No sense of irony in that comment. None. He's, uh He's a simple man.
Clay Jensen:Yep. I'll see you later<TME>.
Tony Padilla:Clay<NME><ATT>, I think you got something that belongs to me.
Clay Jensen:I do? 
Tony Padilla:My keys.
Clay Jensen:Oh, yeah, right. Here. I'll see you later<TME>.

<17><DPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Lainie Jensen:Everything okay? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah. No, I just forgot something.
Lainie Jensen:Clay<NME><SOT><SAT><NGF>, your forehead! 
Clay Jensen:What? It's nothing.
Lainie Jensen:Did you fall off your bike or something? 
Clay Jensen:Low-hanging branch. I went through the woods. It was dark.
Lainie Jensen:I'll get the first aid kit.
Clay Jensen:I don't need first aid.
Lainie Jensen:You are bleeding. You need ointment.
Clay Jensen:Mom, please don't say "ointment".  I'm fine, really.
Lainie Jensen:What happened?
Clay Jensen:I told you, bike, branch, skin.
Lainie Jensen:That's all? 
Clay Jensen:Mom<NME><NGF><SOT>, I tell you everything about my life because it is so fascinating, I promise. I'll clean it up. I have to go. Tony's waiting.
Lainie Jensen:<ITR><FLE><HSP>Ah-ah--Your helmet, please.

<18><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Love the helmet. It's adorable.
Clay Jensen:You mean "adorable" in a helpless baby animal sort of way, I'm guessing.
Hannah Baker:Aren't you afraid of helmet hair? 
Clay Jensen:My hair does the same thing no matter what, just sits there.
Hannah Baker:You just need some product. A little effort to style it, blow-dry it in the morning<TME>.
Clay Jensen:And sacrifice my masculinity? 
Hannah Baker:That ship has sailed, don't you think? 
Clay Jensen:Forgive me for wanting to keep my brains in my head.
Hannah Baker:Instead of, say, some other regions, like most boys? Come on, Helmet<NME><ISR><SOT><MPH>, you've got bathrooms to clean.
Clay Jensen:You mean "we've got.
Hannah Baker:Mm. I don't, actually. Oh, uh, party at my house tomorrow night<TME>. You're invited. It's mandatory. Don't bring the helmet.
Clay Jensen:Cool. Where, uh where do you live?


<19><MPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Kat:He came! Clay's here! 
Hannah Baker:I win! You owe me five dollars.
Kat:Oh, my God.
Clay Jensen:You bet on me? 
Kat:Against you. Last party I saw Clay at mm, my birthday, fourth grade<TME>.
Clay Jensen:I still remember that clown.
Kat:Mm! Oh, my God. He was a heroin addict. My mother the social worker hired a recovering heroin addict. He had the shakes. Okay, uh, drinks. Come on. Excuse me.
Clay Jensen:I just thought he was nervous.
Kat:Hey.
Student A: Hi, Kat<NME><ATT>.
Clay Jensen:This is quite a turnout. People are happy to see you go.
Kat:I really just threw it so Hannah could finally meet some people before I depart this realm.
Clay Jensen:I met Helmet.
Kat:Clay doesn't count. You met him at work.
Clay Jensen:I feel like that should count.
Kat:Of course you do. Okay, refills. Clay<NME><ATT><SOT>, what is your drink? 
Clay Jensen:Uh, Sprite.
Kat:Oh, my God, you are priceless. You are a gem. You'll have a beer.
Clay Jensen:Sure, I like beer.
Tyler: Kat<NME><ATT><SAT>.
Kat:Oh. Picture.
Hannah Baker:Stop having so much fun, Clay<NME><NULL>.
Clay Jensen:I'm having fun, totally. Woot! 
Hannah Baker:You're too buttoned up.

<20><MPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Bryce Walker:Hey there.
Hannah Baker:Hey.
Bryce Walker:You're, um, you're the new girl.

Bryce Walker:Uh, I like your laugh.
Hannah Baker:Thanks. I like your understated sense of fashion.
Bryce Walker:Thanks.
Kat:Bryce<NME><ATT><NGF>. Better go hit the keg and catch up. You're an hour behind<TME>.
Bryce Walker:I'll see you later<TME> I hope.
Hannah Baker:See you.
Kat:Oh, God, no. Solid no, Hannah<NME><NULL>. He is, like, frat boy Darth Vader.
Hannah Baker:He didn't seem that bad.
Kat:I was being kind.
Clay Jensen:She kind of was.
Hannah Baker:I think I want a beer too.
Kat:Okay, then, Princess Leia<NME><MPH><ISR>.
Hannah Baker:Oh, my God, you're both nerds.
Kat:Have fun. Are you gonna tell her? 
Clay Jensen:Tell her what? 
Kat:Oh, please. I've known you this entire century.
Clay Jensen:Well, give me a break. I'm not good with the you know, and the gay rumors only recently subsided.
Kat:Mmm. So the stakes are high for you.
Clay Jensen:It's like, around her, I can be different, you know? I'm the new and improved Clay Jensen: high school sophomore, archaeologist-slash-adventurer.
Kat:Clay<NME><ATT><SOT>, sweets<NME><ISR><PSF><MPH>, you're a prize. But from my limited observation, she has terrible taste in guys.
Clay Jensen:You won't say anything to her? 
Kat:Only if it comes up.
Clay Jensen:Kat<NME><SAT><NGF>! 

<21><DPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Kat:Meet the boys. Justin Foley is mine, and Zach Dempsey for you.
Clay Jensen:Zach Dempsey? Really? 
Kat:What? Zach's sweet? 
Kat:Okay, yeah, he's kind of dumb, but he's the sweet kind of dumb, which is the best kind. 

<22><MPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Kat:Yes. Liberty High's star athletes<NME><ATT><SOT><MPH>, ladies and gentlemen. So impressive. Sorry, boys<NME><SAT><NGF>. Can't have you in Hannah's house soaking wet.
Justin Foley:Seriously? 
Kat:Oh, my God, look at yourselves.
Justin Foley:Better? 
Kat:Improvement, for sure, but sorry, it's still a no-go.
Zach Dempsey:Come on! It's not a party without us.
Kat:We'll take our chances. Go dry off.
Justin Foley:Your loss, milady<NME><NGF><MPH>.
Kat:Idiots<NME><PSF><MPH><SAT>. I can't even...
Clay Jensen:But they're sweet idiots.

<23><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Justin Foley:Hey. Hannah<NME><ATT>, right? 
Hannah Baker:Right.
Justin Foley:Justin. Foley<NME><ISR><SOT>. I saw you at the party the other night<TME>.
Hannah Baker:Yeah, I saw you too. You're drier now<TME>.
Justin Foley:Yeah, well, we went home and changed.
Hannah Baker:Was it profound? 
Justin Foley:Huh? 
Hannah Baker:Your change.
Justin Foley:Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. 
Justin Foley:So, uh<PAS> Kat's gone.
Hannah Baker:Yeah. Sucks<TBW>. You talk to her?

Hannah Baker:Yeah, me too.<PAS> A little. I, uh<PAS>, should get to class.
Justin Foley:Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally. So, I'll see you around, then.
Hannah Baker:I guess you will.

<24><DPP><IDT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Kat:Zach who?
Hannah Baker:Dempsey.
Kat:Oh! Sorry, love. I'm learning all these new boy names, and I've dragged most of the old ones into the Trash icon in my head.
Hannah Baker:Yeah. So, anyway, I know you wanted me to hook up with Zach, but...
Kat:But<ITR><FLE><ESP>...you're into Justin.
Hannah Baker:I'm evil.
Kat:No. Hardly. He's jock crack. I get it. He's all yours.
Hannah Baker:No, I would never...
Kat:Seriously<ITR><FLE><ESP>, I have moved on, times 2,000 miles, and I'm dating hipsters now<TME>. He's all yours.

<25><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Whoa! Careful, there.
Justin Foley:Hannah<NME><ATT>, I'm sorry about that.
Hannah Baker:Geometry with Bates. No wonder you're in a hurry.
Justin Foley:Oh, you have him, too?
Hannah Baker:Fifth period<TME>. The worst ten hours of my day.
Hannah Baker:Speaking of, gotta go.
Justin Foley:Oh, yeah, great. Um I'll see you later<TME>?
Hannah Baker:You will!

<26><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>

Clay Jensen:Oh, uh<PAS> Coach Patrick assigned the game for history homework, so...
Hannah Baker:So<ITR><FLE><ESP>, <PAS>sit.
Clay Jensen:Uh<PAS>, yeah. Okay.
Hannah Baker:You always stand and fidget. It makes me anxious.
Clay Jensen:Tootsie Roll?
Hannah Baker:How can you eat those? Seriously, what does that look like to you? 
Clay Jensen:Like all that's good and sweet in the world. Mm.
Clay Jensen:I didn't figure you for a sports person.
Hannah Baker:I want to get the complete high school experience.
Clay Jensen:Justin is the complete high school experience? 
Hannah Baker:Shut up! Don't be jealous, Clay<NME><NULL>. You'll fill out. Someday<TME>. Maybe. Is your Dad also thin and nervous? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, pretty much.

<27><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Hey, Helmet<NME><ATT><MPH>.
Clay Jensen:Hey.
Hannah Baker:Can you email me your French notes? I can't understand Madam Steinberg. It's like she's speaking German.
Clay Jensen:Sure.
Justin Foley:Ride home? 
Hannah Baker:Thanks, but no. My chariot awaits. Bye, Clay<NME><NULL>. See you, Justin<NME><NULL>.
Justin Foley:You guys go.
Zach Dempsey:Whoa! No way! The bus? 
Justin Foley:Yo, bus with hot girl<NME><PSF><MPH>, car with idiots<NME><PSF><MPH>? 

<28><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Justin Foley:Hey, is that seat taken? 
Hannah Baker:You don't take the bus.
Justin Foley:I don't? Well, then, I guess it's your lucky day.
Hannah Baker:You clearly don't lack confidence.
Justin Foley:You clearly don't have geometry with Mr.Bates fifth period<TME>.
Hannah Baker:You did research.
Justin Foley:No. Yes, I mean I don't know, maybe.
Hannah Baker:I like it. It shows initiative.
Justin Foley:So, could I like maybe get your number or something? 
Hannah Baker:Or something? So, I could give you my number or give you some fake nuclear launch codes? 
Justin Foley:I'll just take your number.
Hannah Baker:I'll just take your phone.
Justin Foley:Huh?

Olivia Baker:Math. Oh. All right, then. Let me know if you need my help.
Hannah Baker:So, you needed help with a math problem? 
Justin Foley:No. I just said that to get you alone on the phone.
Hannah Baker:Because I've got homework of my own, and I can't just talk on the phone all afternoon.
Justin Foley:Okay, I can call you back.
Hannah Baker:No! I I mean, uh, what problem were you having trouble with? The one about the, uh<PAS> trains?

Justin Foley:Oh! I get it.
Justin Foley:Um<PAS> Train "A" is leaving my house in a few minutes. Train "B" is leaving your house in ... 
Hannah Baker:In 30 minutes<TME>.

Hannah Baker:Eisenhower Park. Rocket slide.
Hannah Baker:Oh, my God.

<30><DPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Justin Foley:How was that?

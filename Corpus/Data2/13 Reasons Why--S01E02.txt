Lainie Jensen:Clay<NME><ATT><SAT>, you're gonna be late. I made breakfast.
Clay Jensen:You you did what? 
Lainie Jensen:We're all having breakfast together this morning<TME>.
Clay Jensen:Oh. We are? 
Lainie Jensen:Are you awake?  Are you alive? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, I'm alive. Door closed.
Lainie Jensen:I have to be able to see you to know you're alive. It's a minimum requirement.
Clay Jensen:You heard my voice.
Lainie Jensen:I heard indistinct mumbles.
Clay Jensen:Well, you take what you can get in this life, Mom<NME><NULL>.
Lainie Jensen:Shower, then breakfast. Downstairs, please.

<2><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><DSX>
Lainie Jensen:Eggs'll be ready in a minute<TME>. Dig into the French toast. Want cream with that? 
Clay Jensen:It's all right.
Matt Jensen:You don't drink coffee.
Clay Jensen:I don't eat breakfast either, so 
Lainie Jensen:It has been almost two weeks<TME> since we sat for dinner together as a family. I am nothing if not a realist, so I am proposing that we have family breakfast every day instead. We just each have to get up a little bit early.
Clay Jensen:How early did you have to get up? Yesterday<TME>? 
Lainie Jensen:We won't do the full spread every day<TME>, but it's nice to start off right. So, how'd your project end up last night<TME>? With Tony<NME>.
Clay Jensen:Fine.
Lainie Jensen:For history, right? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, uh, it's, um,<PAS> it's this oral history project, about, like, students who came before us and stuff.
Lainie Jensen:Clay<NME><NGF>, we know the last few weeks<TME> have been hard.
Clay Jensen:I stopped taking these two years ago<TME>.
Lainie Jensen:Dr.Ellman said you could have them available if needed.
Clay Jensen:They're not. And they're probably, like, expired anyway.
Lainie Jensen:It's a new prescription.
Clay Jensen:I gotta go. I need to get ready for school.
Lainie Jensen:Don't forget your lunch! 
Matt Jensen:Might've been a more subtle way to introduce the idea.
Lainie Jensen:He's keeping secrets.
Matt Jensen:He's 17. I'd be worried about him if he weren't keeping secrets.
Lainie Jensen:Secret-keeping is learned behavior. As is the silence.

Trainer:Hey. Skinny kid<NME><ATT><MPH><NGF>. Closed practice. Out.
Clay Jensen:Sorry, I just, uh Is Justin here? Justin Foley? We've got this assignment, and 
Trainer:Who are you? 
Clay Jensen:Clay Jensen. I'm in your fifth-period history class.
Trainer:Oh, yeah, quiet kid<NME><MPH>.
Clay Jensen:Yeah. So, uh, is he here? 
Trainer:He's not. And he wasn't here yesterday<TME>. He'd better be here for this pep rally today<TME>. So, if you see him, tell him his ass gonna be running suicides until the lights go out.
Clay Jensen:I will. If I see him, I'll tell him. Sorry to interrupt your practice.
Trainer:Hey, Jensen<NME><ATT><ISR>.
Clay Jensen:Yeah, Coach<NME><NULL>?
Trainer:Tell me something. Justin he in any kind of trouble? 
Clay Jensen:I don't know.
Trainer:Okay. Tell him to come and see me. No matter what, I'm here, okay?

Jessica Davis:Hey. Where the hell<TBW> is Justin? 
Zach Dempsey:I don't know, Jess<NME><NULL>.
Jessica Davis:You don't know? 
Zach Dempsey:Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.
Jessica Davis:Did he ride with you guys today<TME>? 
Zach Dempsey:No.
Jessica Davis:So, where is he? Marcus<NME><ATT><SAT><NGF>? Did you see him last night<TME>? 
Marcus Cole:Yeah, yeah, he was at practice.
Jessica Davis:Why won't he answer my calls or texts? 
Marcus Cole:I'm sure he'll be there.
Jessica Davis:Oh, you're sure. Thanks, Marcus<NME><MPH>. Mr.Porter wants to see me now<TME>. He left a call slip in my homeroom. 
Teacher:Miss. Davis<NME><ATT><ISR><SAT><SOT><NGF><ITR><FIF><HSP>. Don't you have a class to get to?
Jessica Davis:Tell him I need to talk to him. Now.<TME> What you listening to, Clay<NME>?

Sheri Holland:Hey, Clay<NME><ATT>.
Clay Jensen:Oh. Hey, Sheri<NME><NULL>.
Sheri Holland:How's everything? 
Clay Jensen:Everything is everything.
Sheri Holland:I saw you and Coach Patrick this morning<TME>. What a jerk, right? 
Clay Jensen:Well, kind of.
Sheri Holland:You were looking for Justin? 
Clay Jensen:Have you seen him? 
Sheri Holland:No, but Jessica's a bit freaked because she's his cheer escort to the assembly, and she missed the morning run-through looking for him. This is her first event with the squad, and her round-offs are a bit shaky, so...<PAS>
Clay Jensen:Well, that's worrisome. Yeah.
Sheri Holland:Right. Why were you looking for him? 
Clay Jensen:No reason. Just homework. This is me, so...<PAS>
Sheri Holland:Clay<NME><ATT><PSF>. Clay<NME><ATT><PSF>, are you sure you're okay? 
Clay Jensen:I'm trying to be.
Sheri Holland:Yeah. You know, I miss her, too. A lot.
Clay Jensen:You and Hannah were friends.
Sheri Holland:Well, you know, friendship's complicated, but<PAS> we were, yeah.
Clay Jensen:She ever tell you Did she ever say anything about me? 
Sheri Holland:Hm? 
Clay Jensen:Anything<PAS> bad? 
Sheri Holland:God, no! No, Clay<NME><NULL>, she liked you so much.
Sheri Holland:Shoot. German. I can't be late. Uh We should get coffee or something sometime. Monet's? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, sure. Be great.

Hannah Baker:Hey.
Jessica Davis:Hey.
Hannah Baker:Mrs.Antilly? 
Jessica Davis:Yeah.
Hannah Baker:Me, too. Any clue why? 
Jessica Davis:None.
Mrs. Antilly:My new students<NME><ATT><ISR><PSF><SAT>! Come in! Come in! 
Mrs. Antilly:Did you two get a chance to meet outside? Hannah<NME><SAT>, meet Jessica. Jessica<NME><SAT>, meet Hannah. You're both new to Liberty, and I thought it would be good for you to know each other. I thought, and I know this isn't how things are usually done, but I thought you could be friends.
Mrs. Antilly:Now, I recognize it's unusual to assign someone a friend, so think of it as a friendly face in a crowd, until you get your bearings.
Jessica Davis:So you want us to smile at each other in the hall? 
Hannah Baker:And how will that help us, like, directionally? 
Mrs. Antilly:Well, the point is, you won't be strangers. Starting at a new school can feel overwhelming. I just want you to have an ally. Two allies. Count me in as well.
Hannah Baker:So, just to be clear, we should smile at you in the hallway too? 
Mrs. Antilly:Sure! I'd love that! Listen. I'm not under any illusion that this school is a friendly place. I'd like it to be. It isn't always, but we three, we can be there for each other! That's all.
Jessica Davis:Mrs. Antilly<NME><ATT><SOT>, I'm sure Hillary<NME><MPH> is awesome, but...
Hannah Baker:If we're gonna be great friends<ITR><FLE><ESP>, you should know my name is Hannah<NME>.
Jessica Davis:What did I call you? 
Hannah Baker:Hillary<NME><MPH>.
Jessica Davis:That's not your name? 
Hannah Baker:No. Hannah.
Jessica Davis:Crap. I already got your best friend necklace engraved with "Hillary".
Hannah Baker:Any students named Hillary we can set up with Jennifer<NME><MPH>? 
Jessica Davis:Jessica<ITR><FLE><ESP>.
Hannah Baker:Sorry. Jezebel<NME><MPH>.
Jessica Davis:No problem, Harriet<NME><MPH>.
Hannah Baker:Ooh. Can I actually get a Jezebel<NME><MPH>? She'd be an amazing friend.
Mrs. Antilly:See? See, the senses of humor on you two. It's a perfect match! 
Hannah Baker:Yeah.
Jessica Davis:Clearly.

<7><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:Hey, Helmet<NME><ATT>.
Clay Jensen:Hey. Why are you smiling? 
Hannah Baker:Why shouldn't I smile? 
Clay Jensen:No, I mean, you should. I was just asking if there was an immediate recent cause or something? 
Hannah Baker:You literally can manufacture an existential crisis out of thin air. It's a gift! It's a true gift.

<8><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Mr. Porter:Hey. Is this yours? 
Clay Jensen:Thanks, Mr.Porter<NME><NULL>.
Mr. Porter:Haven't seen one of these in a long time. What you listening to? 
Clay Jensen:Um<PAS> My dad had some tapes. Um Old music. Ultravox? Duran...<PAS> Duran? 
Mr. Porter:Yeah, sure. Good stuff, man. I do more jazz myself, but music is all good. It gets you through the day.
Mr. Porter:Here you go. Um Listen, Clay<NME><SOT><SAT>, I would like to talk to you sometime about Hannah Baker<NME>.
Clay Jensen:Um<PAS> Hannah? Why? 
Mr. Porter:I'm just trying to understand what happened. I know you guys were friends. You worked together, right? Yeah.
Clay Jensen:Um<PAS> But, I mean, yeah.
Mr. Porter:Just come by my office and we'll just talk sometime, all right? 
Clay Jensen:Mm-hmm<PAS>.
Mr. Porter:All right.

<9><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Hannah Baker:Hey, Joanne<NME><ATT><MPH>.
Jessica Davis:Hazel<NME><ATT><MPH>. Hey.
Hannah Baker:Are you following me? 
Jessica Davis:Um, I'm ahead of you. 
Hannah Baker:Fair point. This is a disaster. We're walking in the same direction.
Jessica Davis:Pretty much the end of the world.
Hannah Baker:Impossibly Perky Counselor Lady can't turn out to be right.
Jessica Davis:How many cats do you think she has? Five? Seven? 
Hannah Baker:I was thinking 12.
Jessica Davis:And they're all, like, obese and purr...<PAS>
Hannah Baker:Really loud.
Jessica Davis:Where you going, anyway? 
Hannah Baker:Home. I live on Bristol. You? 
Jessica Davis:I'm going to Monet's for a hot chocolate.
Hannah Baker:Hot chocolate. Intriguing. Especially as the day is warm.
Jessica Davis:Hot chocolate is the cure for all things shitty in life.
Hannah Baker:Huh. I got shit that needs curing, too.

<10><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Hannah Baker:Yeah, Kat was the best. When she moved, I just...<PAS> Yeah, well, it sucked.
Jessica Davis:I leave friends behind every two years. We're always moving.
Hannah Baker:Parents on the lam? 
Jessica Davis:Dad in the Air Force.
Hannah Baker:So you're always the new kid.
Jessica Davis:I had this friend, Amy<PAS>. I told her everything, including my series of embarrassing sex dreams featuring various Avengers, including Scarlett Johansson. Then one day, you know, the moving trucks come. I'm like, "Bye! Don't tell anyone about that Scarlett Johansson thing!" But she posts about it because that's the only communication you have anymore.
Hannah Baker:And it ends up getting around your new school.
Jessica Davis:And gets completely twisted.
Hannah Baker:So you end up That Girl.
Jessica Davis:I am so That Girl.
Hannah Baker:I'm That Other Girl.
Hannah Baker:Stupid Mrs. Antilly.
Jessica Davis:Bitch<TBW> is good at her job.

<11><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:Jessica<NME><ATT>. Hey, Jessica<NME><ATT>.
Jessica Davis:What, Clay<NME><SAT><NGF>? 
Clay Jensen:Why are you avoiding Mr. Porter? 
Jessica Davis:I don't know what you're talking about.
Clay Jensen:You took off when you saw him. Does he know about the tapes? 
Jessica Davis:Are you crazy? Shut your mouth.
Clay Jensen:I'm just trying to figure this out.
Jessica Davis:Then listen, don't talk.
Clay Jensen:But what happened to Justin? Why isn't he here? 
Jessica Davis:I don't know. Mr.Porter pulled him in yesterday<TME>, then he walked out of Porter's office and out of school and vanished.
Clay Jensen:Is everything okay with you guys? You're together, right? 
Jessica Davis:Yes, we're together, and we're fine, okay? Thank you, Clay<NME><SAT><NGF>.
Clay Jensen:I didn't mean to.
Jessica Davis:Forget it. Just<PAS> don't believe everything you hear. Okay? 

<12><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Hannah Baker:That top is perfect for you.
Jessica Davis:It shows too much of my arms. They're so fat.
Hannah Baker:They're not.
Jessica Davis:I have substitute teacher arms.
Hannah Baker:Uh-oh. We've got a stalker.
Jessica Davis:Where? 
Hannah Baker:Play it cool. Three o'clock.
Jessica Davis:It's after three<TME>.
Hannah Baker:No, three o'clock. Directional.<PAS> Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.
Jessica Davis:He's a logistics expert, mostly.
Hannah Baker:Look over there.
Jessica Davis:He's checking you out.
Hannah Baker:He's checking you out.
Jessica Davis:No, you, and he's cute.
Hannah Baker:He's alone.
Jessica Davis:So? 
Hannah Baker:So that means he doesn't have any friends. That's weird.
Jessica Davis:We didn't have any friends two weeks ago<TME>.

<13><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Alex Standall:Um<PAS> Hey.
Jessica Davis:Hey.
Hannah Baker:Hey.
Jessica Davis:We saw you staring at us and wondered which one of us you were checking out.
Alex Standall:Oh, I wasn't.
Jessica Davis:Oh, come on, don't play dumb. Do we look dumb? 
Alex Standall:No. I mean<PAS>, no.
Hannah Baker:Have you ever heard of the male gaze? 
Alex Standall:The?<PAS> No.
Hannah Baker:Well, we have.
Jessica Davis:And we're not totally sure what it means, but you have it.
Hannah Baker:You should at least explain why you're sitting alone.
Jessica Davis:My friend thinks that makes you weird. Are you weird? 
Alex Standall:Well, I can't objectively answer the "weird" thing, but I'm sitting alone 'cause I just moved here. I don't know anybody.
Hannah Baker:What's your name? 
Alex Standall:It's Alex. Alex Standall.
Hannah Baker:Okay, Alex Alex Standall<NME><NULL>. We are prepared to invite you to our table if you can answer one question. What is depicted on the giant painting they just hung on that wall? 
Alex Standall:Uh. It's a giant bleeding man? Or squid? Or man-squid. Uh In spring.
Hannah Baker:Good enough. You're in.
Alex Standall:Okay. Thanks. Uh, what am I in, exactly? 
Jessica Davis:If you have to ask, you don't know.

<14><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Teacher:Mr.Jensen.<NME><ATT> Not so fast, young man<NME><ISR>, you're wanted at the office.
Clay Jensen:<PAS>Why? What for? 
Teacher:Surprisingly, they don't send a complete explanation. They send a summons. Attendance. So, I guess this has to do with your attendance.

<15><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><DSP><SSX>
Clay Jensen:What is it? Daily report.
Teacher:You're on attendance alert starting this week<TME>.
Clay Jensen:Attendance alerts? 
Teacher:You need to make sure you are marked present by all teachers, and the first two weeks<TME>, they have to note your participation.
Clay Jensen:But why am I on these? I have good attendance.
Teacher:Someone wants to make sure you keep it that way.
Clay Jensen:I'm supposed to present a project with Justin Foley, and he wasn't here for homeroom. Did he have a late admit? 
Teacher:I can't release information on another student.
Teacher:Another doctor's note, Alex<NME><NULL>? 
Alex Standall:Yep, another one. It's the same doctor.
Teacher:Okay.
Clay Jensen:Hey, man<NME><ATT>.
Alex Standall:Hey, Clay<NME><NULL>.
Clay Jensen:How are you doing? 
Alex Standall:How am I doing? How are you doing? Yeah.

<16><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Alex Standall:Females! 
Jessica Davis:Male! 
Alex Standall:I have concluded that this school sucks! Except for you guys.
Jessica Davis:We fully support your conclusions.
Hannah Baker:Let's discuss this in our office this afternoon.
Jessica Davis:Wait, our office? 
Hannah Baker:My God. Monet's.
Jessica Davis:Oh, right. I love it.

<17><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Alex Standall:F.M.L.<TBW>
Jessica Davis:Why? What happened? 
Alex Standall:I got put in remedial math because my math from my old school is not the same math they have here. Who knew that there was different math? 
Jessica Davis:But I bet there's a hot troubled bad boy in remedial math. He broods, he wears leather, he's got a past he doesn't talk about and trouble with long division.
Alex Standall:There are a couple of pregnant girls.
Hannah Baker:Will your parents freak? My dad would freak.
Alex Standall:Yeah, my mom might, but my dad's a cop, so as long as I stand up straight and pass P.E.,<PAS> go shooting with him... 
Jessica Davis:Wait, your dad's a cop?<ITR><FIM><ESP> And you go shooting with him? With guns? How did I not know about this? 
Alex Standall:You never asked, I guess.
Jessica Davis:I love a man in uniform. I would like to meet your father.
Alex Standall:Ew. And your dad wears a uniform.
Jessica Davis:Oh, yeah. I never thought about that.

<18><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:F.M.L.<TBW>
Jessica Davis:F.M.L.<TBW>
Alex Standall:F.M.L.<TBW>
Jessica Davis:Ew. Cappuccino fingers.
Alex Standall:Sorry, sorry.
Jessica Davis:Fuck Justin. 
Alex Standall:You don't even have to talk about it.
Jessica Davis:Ever.
Hannah Baker:<PAS>Okay.
Jessica Davis:Okay. Did you guys take that Vocational Interests and Aptitude Test? We got our results back today<TME>, and I'm suited to be...

<19><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Jessica Davis:What the hell<TBW> is that? 
Jessica Davis:I'm working my way through the menu. I'm committed to this.
Jessica Davis:God, you're weird.
Jessica Davis:No, I'm a searcher.
Jessica Davis:The fact that you just called yourself a searcher is weird.
Jessica Davis:Something's up with you today<TME>.
Jessica Davis:My dad's being deployed again.
Hannah Baker:Oh, man. I'm so sorry, Jess<NME><PSF>.
Jessica Davis:Wow, that sucks<TBW>.
Jessica Davis:He'll be in the Middle East somewhere, and he can't tell us where, probably because it's some country we're not supposed to be at war with.
Hannah Baker:F.M.L.<TBW>forever.
Jessica Davis:F.M.L.<TBW>forever.
Alex Standall:F.M.L.<TBW>forever.

<20><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Ms. Bradley:I'm surprised, you know? 
Mr. Porter:Yeah.
Ms. Bradley:I mean, the other day<TME>, I'm handing out the family dynamics papers, and I see hers.
Mr. Porter:Mmm.
Ms. Bradley:I swear to God, I just about lost it.
Mr. Porter:Yeah.I imagine.It's still fresh.
Ms. Bradley:I know. I mean, I've been losing sleep. I had Hannah in my class two years<TME> in a row.
Mr. Porter:How many students do you have, Pam<NME><ISR>? Hm? 
Ms. Bradley:That's not the point.
Mr. Porter:Over 200. I have 600 on the advisory list.
Ms. Bradley:That's not...<PAS>

<21><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Hannah Baker:That shit'll kill you, you know.
Clay Jensen:You got a salad from McDonald's, the people who make the Big Mac.
Hannah Baker:Are you fat-shaming my salad? 
Clay Jensen:You called my lunch a murderer.
Hannah Baker:Thank you.
Clay Jensen:Anytime.
Hannah Baker:Can I ask you a super-needy, when-did- I-become-this-kind-of-girl question? Oh, my God. Unfreeze. It's not about my period.
Clay Jensen:Okay.
Hannah Baker:Do you think I could ever be as pretty as Jessica Davis? 
Hannah Baker:Great. Thanks. Got it.
Clay Jensen:No, I-I just I mean, yeah, Jessica's pretty and all, but you're special.
Hannah Baker:Special. Like retarded.
Clay Jensen:Did I say retarded? I didn't say retarded, and I don't think we're supposed to use that word anymore.
Hannah Baker:Regardless I saw you try to be kind and, you know, fail.
Clay Jensen:Wait, I didn't... Wait, how did this conversation go so wrong, so fast? 
Hannah Baker:It's how you're socialized. I keep thinking you're some different kind of male. Clearly, there's no such thing.

<22><MPP><DRT><DKH><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Jessica Davis:Hey. You're here? 
Hannah Baker:No, I'm animatronic.
Jessica Davis:You don't work Wednesdays<TME>.
Hannah Baker:I'm covering for Karen.
Jessica Davis:Oh, okay. Yeah. That's cool.
Hannah Baker:I guess. She's in a junior college play, A Few Good Men, which is so not the story of her life.
Jessica Davis:Oh, thanks.
Hannah Baker:Put it away. What good is having a best friend who works at the movies if you can't get in for free? 
Alex Standall:Hey, Hannah<NME><ATT>.
Hannah Baker:Hey, Alex<NME><NULL>. Fancy seeing you here.
Alex Standall:Hey, you work Wednesdays<TME>? 
Hannah Baker:Covered this. Jess can fill you in.
Alex Standall:Oh, yeah, we were, um we were just hanging out.
Alex Standall:Together.
Hannah Baker:So I see.
Alex Standall:Cool. Um<PAS> So, could I get one? 
Hannah Baker:Ten dollars, please.
Alex Standall:Oh. Um<PAS> Here you go.
Hannah Baker:Enjoy your movie. Please, let us know if we can make your visit more pleasant.
Alex Standall:Okay.

<23><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Jessica<NME><ATT>? 
Jessica Davis:What, Clay<NME><NGF><SAT>? What do you want?
Clay Jensen:We need to talk.
Jessica Davis:No, we don't.
Clay Jensen:We have to tell someone about Justin. Like, Mr. Porter.
Jessica Davis:Mr. Porter? Really? That's a fantastic idea.
Clay Jensen:Does he know about the tapes? 
Jessica Davis:I will say it one more time. Keep your mouth shut, got it?
Clay Jensen:Jess<NME><ATT>!
Jessica Davis:Back off<ITR><FLE><ESP>, Clay<NME><NGF>! Leave me alone.

<24><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Hannah Baker:What?
Jessica Davis:We need to talk.

<25><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Marcus Cole:Hey, Clay<NME><ATT>. What's up, man? 
Clay Jensen:Hey, Marcus<NME><NULL>.
Zach Dempsey:Need a ride?
Marcus Cole:Where you going?
Clay Jensen:I'm good. I got my bike.
Zach Dempsey:Just throw it in the trunk. We're gonna go hang at Bryce's. You should totally come.
Tony Padilla:Hey, Clay<NME><ATT><SOT>. You all right? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah, thanks.
Tony Padilla:You sure? 
Clay Jensen:Yeah.
Tony Padilla:You heard him, boys. He's all right.

<26><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Hannah Baker:F.M.L.<TBW>? 
Jessica Davis:I should have known. I know the rumors, Hannah<NME><NGF>.
Hannah Baker:Well, you can't know rumors. You can hear them, but you can't know them.
Jessica Davis:We were friends. How could you betray me like that? 
Hannah Baker:Like what? What did I do? 
Jessica Davis:Is it you and Alex now? 
Hannah Baker:No! How could you even... Of course not!  He likes you, you like him. I'm the one who's out.
Jessica Davis:Yeah, and that pissed you off, didn't it? 
Hannah Baker:A little. I mean It made me sad. Why didn't you just tell me? 
Jessica Davis:Maybe I was afraid of something like this.
Hannah Baker:Something like what? Jess<NME><NGF>. You know this doesn't mean anything.
Jessica Davis:Don't act innocent.
Hannah Baker:But I am innocent. I had nothing to do with this. Alex did this on his own.
Jessica Davis:He just broke up with me on his own.
Hannah Baker:I didn't know he broke up with you.
Jessica Davis:I'll just say this: enjoy it. 'Cause you will, won't you?' Cause that's what sluts<TBW> do.
Hannah Baker:Fuck you<TBW>.

<27><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><DSX>
Clay Jensen:Is it working? The hot chocolate? 
Jessica Davis:No.
Clay Jensen:Why did you and Hannah fight? I don't get it.
Jessica Davis:Of course you don't. You're a guy.
Clay Jensen:You guys were friends.
Jessica Davis:We weren't friends. Friends tell the truth, friends don't turn on each other. Hannah's a user and a liar. You can't believe anything that she says. Not a thing. I mean, what she said, on the tapes, about us and Monet's, she's the one who stopped coming, not me. She's the one who ended our friendship, and she knew it. She's a liar. Was a liar.
Clay Jensen:Why would she lie? 
Jessica Davis:Why do you think? 
Clay Jensen:I don't know. I don't understand any of this. I mean, I know people talk. Relationships start. They end. I guess I always thought, "How much does high school stuff really matter?" But I mean, it does. But, you know, it We're only here for four years<TME>.
Jessica Davis:If you live that long.
Clay Jensen:Can I ask you something? Zach and Marcus really wanted to give me a ride just now<TME> at school.
Jessica Davis:So? 
Clay Jensen:So that's never happened before<TME>. They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.
Jessica Davis:At Bryce's? Oh, my God. Of course they did.
Clay Jensen:Any idea how I acquired these new friends? 
Jessica Davis:They're not your friends.

<28><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Bryce Walker:Official word is he's not here.
Zach Dempsey:Yeah, well, Coach is looking for him now<TME>, too. He's fucking<TBW> pissed that he missed the assembly.
Bryce Walker:He's in the pool house. Stoned off his gourd, by the way.
Marcus Cole:He's been here all day<TME>? 
Bryce Walker:Yeah, since last night<TME>. What'd he do? 
Zach Dempsey:Who the fuck<TBW> knows? 

<29><MPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Zach Dempsey:Yo, man. You okay? 
Justin Foley:Fuck<TBW> you, am I okay. What are you, my bitch<TBW> now? Close the frickin'<TBW> door.
Marcus Cole:Hey, Jessica's looking for you. She looks bad.
Justin Foley:Yeah, she has for a while.
Zach Dempsey:You gonna talk to her? 
Justin Foley:And say what? 
Marcus Cole:Tell her to get her shit<TBW> together. She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.
Zach Dempsey:And you.
Justin Foley:Not me. I ain't there.

<30><DPP><DRT><DLT><EDU><SSP><SSX>
Tony Padilla:You need a refill? 
Clay Jensen:You're parked in a loading zone.
Tony Padilla:I'm not staying long. That was the table, yeah? 
Clay Jensen:Don't pretend you don't know. You listened to the tapes. You had to. Who else has? 
Tony Padilla:I'm not here to tell you that.
Clay Jensen:Then why are you here? 
Tony Padilla:Clay<NME><NULL>, you're the slowest yet. What is taking you so long? 
Clay Jensen:It's hard. To listen.
Tony Padilla:Of course it is. It's tapes from a dead girl.
Clay Jensen:Doesn't this affect you at all? 
Tony Padilla:More than I can tell you.
Clay Jensen:Why can't you tell me? 
Tony Padilla:You remember seventh grade<TME>? Those fucknuts<TBW> stuck your head in the toilet and that shit<TBW>? 
Clay Jensen:Yes.
Tony Padilla:And I told you that me and my brothers could fix it, and you said, "Sometimes, a guy's gotta get through things on his own." 
Clay Jensen:I remember.
Tony Padilla:This is one of those things.
Clay Jensen:I can't hear her voice without thinking of her. Without seeing her.
Tony Padilla:Seems like maybe that was the idea.

Jessica Davis:You are such a fucking asshole<TBW>!
Justin Foley:Hey!  Come on! Hey!
Jessica Davis:How could you do that to me? What did you tell him?
Justin Foley:What did I tell who? 
Jessica Davis:Mr. Porter! What did you tell him yesterday<TME>? Why haven't you been at school? 
Justin Foley:I just needed a day off to chill.
Jessica Davis:They day<TME> after you talk to Porter, you need a day off? You're not telling me something! 
Justin Foley:What would I not be telling you? 
Jessica Davis:Clay has the tapes now<TME>.
Justin Foley:I know. Don't worry about it.
Jessica Davis:He's not like the rest of us. He could say something.
Justin Foley:He won't talk. We'll make sure of it.
Jessica Davis:You could lose your shot at a scholarship.
Justin Foley:We'll deal with it, okay? Just<PAS> Just chill! 
Justin Foley:How far is he, anyway? 
Jessica Davis:He's not there yet, if that's what you mean.
Jessica Davis:Justin? If Hannah was lying why are you here?

Olivia Baker:Andy<NME><ATT>. Andy<NME><ATT>! 
Andy Baker:It's nothing. If anything, it's a compliment.
Olivia Baker:A compliment?  I don't think so. Well, you remember what we saw on her Facebook, the texts? 
Andy Baker:She had some unkind classmates.
Olivia Baker:She was bullied. This is bullying! 
Andy Baker:I'm not sure the court will see it the same way.
Olivia Baker:With everything else.
Andy Baker:What else? Some text messages? Facebook posts? Online comments? A picture of our daughter on a playground with anonymous insults that might have come from anywhere. We have no idea what that means, or who wrote it, or where it came from.
Olivia Baker:We have to find out, Andy<NME><NULL>.
Andy Baker:What if we find out something we don't want to know? 
Olivia Baker:I know our daughter.
Andy Baker:Are you sure?

Olivia Baker:Hi, um<PAS>, it's Olivia Baker. I'm sorry to bother you again. You've done so much for us already, but, well, we found something inside one of the books in Hannah's locker, and we we don't know what it is, so I was hoping that maybe you could tell us.
Tony Padilla:Sure, Mrs. Baker<NME><NULL>, I can be right over. Yeah, no problem. Yes. All right, bye.
